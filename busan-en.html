                <ol>
            	    <blockquote></blockquote>
            	  <h4>Overview</h4>
            	  <blockquote></blockquote>
            	  <p><strong>Busan</strong>, the full name of Busan Metropolitan City, is 450km southeast of Seoul, South Korea, and the southeast end of the Korean Peninsula. It is the second-largest city in South Korea. The topography of Busan divides the city of Busan into several districts. The urban pattern of a central city and several sub-centers once brought a natural barrier to Busan during the Korean War. Busan also became the temporary capital of South Korea at that time. Scenic spots such as Erjietai, Gamcheon Cultural Village, UN Memorial Hall and so on all silently record the history of Busan. Busan is a well-known deep-water port, the largest port in South Korea, and one of Asia's logistics centers. On its winding coastline, there are high-quality sandy beaches and beautiful seaside scenery. The city is surrounded by mountains and hot springs are dotted around the city. Whether it's mountain scenery or ocean scenery, Busan will be an ideal place for sightseeing. Several major beaches, such as Haeundae, Dadaepo, and Gwanganli, are bustling almost all year round because many themed activities will be held at the major beaches. South Korea's only stock exchange (KRX) is located in Busan. This is also South Korea's International Convention Center. The NURIMARU APEC HOUSE, built for the 2005 APEC Summit, has become a beautiful scenery in Busan because of its peculiar shape. Busan once hosted the 2002 Asian Games and was a branch venue of the World Cup in the same year. Since its establishment in 1996, the Busan International Film Festival has become a popular event for filmmakers, celebrities, and media in Asia and the world for 19 years. Affected by the oceanic climate, the temperature difference between summer and winter is small, and the four seasons change significantly. The wind is stronger than in other places, and it is warm in winter and cool in summer, making it particularly livable.</p>

                  <h4>Culture</h4>
                  <blockquote></blockquote>
                  <p>Busan hosted the 14th Asian Games in 2002 and the Korea-Japan World Cup. The Busan World Film Festival has been held every year since 1996, and Busan has gradually become an international modern city where multiple cultures coexist. The most attractive part of Busan is coastal sightseeing because you can see all kinds of strange rocks and large and small islands on the beaches on the southeast coast, and the scenery of Amnam Park and the marine parks of Ergeidae and Taejongdae are particularly beautiful. The boat viewing is also better. As the seasons change, Busan also presents a different look. In summer, various beaches hold various celebrations; in autumn, the saury market will host the saury cultural sightseeing festival; in winter, the habitat of migratory birds downstream of the Nakdong River has become the focus of attention of tourists. In addition, you can also visit the Busan Marine Natural History Museum, Fuquan Museum, Busan Municipal Art Museum, and Fukuyama Museum, and other cultural venues.</p>

                  <h4>Environment</h4>
                  <blockquote></blockquote>
                  <p>Busan is strategically located at the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula, on the southeast side of the Korean Strait (Korea Strait), facing Tsushima Island in Japan, and facing the Nakdong River in the west. The northwestern mountains stand tall, the south has an island barrier and the south gateway of the peninsula. Because of its unique and superior geographical location, Busan has become the largest port city in South Korea and one of the world-class prosperous seaports. Of course, the superior coastline gave birth to 6 beautiful beaches, and the pleasant seaside scenery and leisure hiking trails are the first choices of tourists. The climate of Busan is mild, and it is a maritime subtropical gusty climate, so there are few blizzards and blizzards. The temperature difference between summer and winter is small, and the four seasons are distinct. Because it is a coastal city, the wind is stronger than in other areas, so it is cool in summer and warm in winter, making it suitable for people to travel. Since the opening of the port in 1876, Busan has gradually become a center of trade and commerce, and its population has gradually increased. As of 2015, Busan has a population of approximately 4 million.</p>
